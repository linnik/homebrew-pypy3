# homebrew-pypy3-nightly
Latest PyPy 3.6 (6.1.0-alpha0) for a Homebrew

## Installation

```
brew install linnik/pypy3-nightly/pypy3
```

If you are on High Sierra then pre-built bottle will be installed, but you also can build from source with `--HEAD` option.

## Build note

Even when using PyPy to build PyPy, translation is time-consuming – 30 minutes on a fast machine – and RAM-hungry. You will need at least 2 GB of memory on a 32-bit machine and 4GB on a 64-bit machine.
